See the [&#x60;taxonomy csv file&#x60;](https://plaid.com/documents/transactions-personal-finance-category-taxonomy.csv) for a full list of personal finance categories.  We’re introducing Category Rules - a new beta endpoint that will enable you to change the &#x60;personal_finance_category&#x60; for a transaction based on your users’ needs. When rules are set, the selected category will override the Plaid provided category. To learn more, send a note to transactions-feedback@plaid.com.
