  # Possible values are &#x60;device&#x60;, &#x60;selections&#x60;, or &#x60;questions&#x60;.  If value is &#x60;device&#x60;, the MFA answer is &#x60;1234&#x60;.  If value is &#x60;selections&#x60;, the MFA answer is always the first option.  If value is &#x60;questions&#x60;, the MFA answer is  &#x60;answer_&lt;i&gt;_&lt;j&gt;&#x60; for the j-th question in the i-th round, starting from 0. For example, the answer to the first question in the second round is &#x60;answer_1_0&#x60;.
