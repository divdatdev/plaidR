test_that("account", {
  # tests for the property `account` (character)
  # The ACH account number for the account.  Note that when using OAuth with Chase Bank (&#x60;ins_56&#x60;), Chase will issue \&quot;tokenized\&quot; routing and account numbers, which are not the user&#39;s actual account and routing numbers. These tokenized numbers should work identically to normal account and routing numbers. The digits returned in the &#x60;mask&#x60; field will continue to reflect the actual account number, rather than the tokenized account number; for this reason, when displaying account numbers to the user to help them identify their account in your UI, always use the &#x60;mask&#x60; rather than truncating the &#x60;account&#x60; number. If a user revokes their permissions to your app, the tokenized numbers will continue to work for ACH deposits, but not withdrawals.
