  # We use standard HTTP response codes for success and failure notifications, and our errors are further classified by &#x60;error_type&#x60;. In general, 200 HTTP codes correspond to success, 40X codes are for developer- or user-related failures, and 50X codes are for Plaid-related issues. Error fields will be &#x60;null&#x60; if no error has occurred.
