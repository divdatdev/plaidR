To circumvent the &#x60;ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED&#x60; error and maintain continuous consent, the end user can reauthenticate via Linkâ€™s update mode in advance of the consent expiration time.  Note - This is only relevant for certain OAuth-based institutions. For all other institutions, this field will be null.
